We need to have a room reservation system in place by the beginning of the Spring semester. 
That should be plenty of time, but I suppose the sooner we start on it the better. 

### Specs
1. Our room reservation system should replace the one from Green Library that we're currently using
2. It should have:
	1. Labels that indicate whether room has 
		1. whiteboard
		2. flat panel
		3. window (room with a view)
		4. Possibly some others
		5. Defined locations (2nd Floor, 3rd Floor, etc)
3. the setup is [here](https://fiulaw.libcal.com/admin/equipment/locations#s-lc-tab-locations)
4. We should work with John Gonzales and Lili Mesa in order to make sure that it's set up and working properly.
