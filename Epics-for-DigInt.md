I. LibGuides Cleanup
	A. Clean up the Code for the dashboard for CSS and JavaScript
		1. CSS is affecting dashboard display making it difficult to add content;
		    the CSS meant for the production page overrides the CSS meant for the dashboard interface of each guide. ~
		    This is done. 
	B. Create a file server for various files we want to display like the Booklist
		We need a file server that is open on the web (meaning it has a public IP address) so that we can add (and easily modify) files like JSON files to our Libguides pages.
	C. Reconfigure the Guide Template to be easier for Librarians to create content
	D. Create a React demo for a brochure look for the faculty display
