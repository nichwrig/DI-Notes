### Talk about Scopus Journals.  2025-11-04

Okay, this is just talking about another thing that DC owns. 
Here are a few things i might be able to take way
- Direct to full text via DOI directing. 
- There's something called impact factor. 

> I'm beginning to get the feeling that folks don't really know what they're doing or why with these things. 

Law journals are unique in that they're not research they're just opinions. Other journals are for the benefit of putative readers; law journals are for the benefit of the article writers. 


> [!question] What in the eff is this for?

**Answer**: Who in the eff knows?
### Some talk about standards or accepting or rejecting journals in Scopus.
- Here's another talk that I don't think will have almost no value for me.
- It looks like she's talking about the acceptance of journals into Scopus. I'll try to find something of value in this presentation. 
- This is not worth my time. I'm hoping for an opportunity to figure out what in the hell this is for and how I can benefit from being here, but now that is not going to heppen.
