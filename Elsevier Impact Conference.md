# Day One
## Introduction

### Talk about Scopus Journals.  2025-11-04

Okay, this is just talking about another thing that DC owns. 
Here are a few things i might be able to take way
- Direct to full text via DOI directing. 
- There's something called impact factor. 

> I'm beginning to get the feeling that folks don't really know what they're doing or why with these things. 

Law journals are unique in that they're not research they're just opinions. Other journals are for the benefit of putative readers; law journals are for the benefit of the article writers. 


> [!question] What in the eff is this for?

**Answer**: Who in the eff knows?
### Some talk about standards or accepting or rejecting journals in Scopus.
- Here's another talk that I don't think will have almost no value for me.
- It looks like she's talking about the acceptance of journals into Scopus. I'll try to find something of value in this presentation. 
- This is not worth my time. I'm hoping for an opportunity to figure out what in the hell this is for and how I can benefit from being here, but now that is not going to happen.

JFC: this is some uninteresting non-relevant stuff. :/. 

### Publishing Journals
- some more useless boring bs. 
- 'Aim and Scope is the key to everything.' - What in the eff does this mean?
- Dude is talking about setting up a Journal in Digital Commons and having like an editorial board and some stuff like that. 

 I guess what I need to understand from this is that Elsevier is a collection of journals and so their scope in pursuing digital commons is to push folks who manage digital commons to think of themselves as journal publishers and as each instance of digital commons to be treated like a journal. Therefore the manager of an Institutional Repository should view himself/herself as some kind of editor in chief. 

### Ethics
- Who cares? For whom does any of this matter?
> [!note] Okay. this might be useful. We should have a lot more policies available on dc. 

I guess I'm learning some new things about publishing article online. There's a difference between a 'retraction' and an 'expression of concern.'

So there some group of people who take online article publishing seriously and have established or at least recognize some rules/distinctions in how online publishing of academic articles is handled. 

There's apparently no way to reverse a retraction. But there's a retraction of a retraction I guess. For this case we have 2 outcomes. The first one if the data is accurate, no misconduct happened the journal can publish a retraction of the retraction. 

Or the 2nd is that there's still a concern maybe they can inform the author to publish a new publication to address all the concern related to the original article. 

# Day 2
### Journals Modules
- There's a new newest release of designs for journals.
  > This should be interesting. I think this in fact might be useful. 
- Common Challenges: need for stable professional site, impact of journal 
- The designs look better. Not great, but it looks better. I'm ready to update now. 

## Repository Modules
- bait and switch advertisement for transition to pure

## Institutional Repository Modules
- Safeguarding access, integrity and security 
- who's guarding the guardians?
