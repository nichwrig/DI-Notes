As an Electronic Resources Librarian for over 4 years at St. Mary’s University Law Library and Georgetown Law Library from 2008 to 2012 I developed a foundation in providing legal research and reference services to law schools. In both positions I played an instrumental role in redesigns of their web platforms and created solutions for access problems to the libraries’ electronic resources. In addition, in both libraries I provided legal research and reference to the law school community. 

From there I worked As the Web Resources Librarian at the University of Texas at Dallas my responsibilities ranged from overseeing access to our electronic resources to administering servers to coding web pages. Notably, I migrated their website from a series of flat HTML files to a comprehensive Content Management System and implemented repository solutions such as Dspace and ArchivesSpace. 


Currently, I am working at FIU as their Digital Collections and Scholarly Services Law Librarian managing our Institutional Repository, our web platforms such as LibGuides, and providing research and reference to the law school. However, I am eager to focus more on IR development and I see this advertised position as an opportunity to grow more in that direction. 

l look forward to speaking with you more about the opportunity and how I can help improve access to the Institutional Repository and better integrate technology into legal instruction and services at the Alexander Campbell King Law Library.
